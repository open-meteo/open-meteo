 * @brief OmFileDecoder: A component for reading and decompressing data from a compressed file format.
 * 
 * The OmFileDecoder provides functions and structures for reading chunks of compressed data,
 * decompressing them, and storing the results into a target buffer. It supports various compression
 * schemes and allows reading partial or entire datasets in a chunked manner.

 * This function sets up the `om_decoder_t` instance, configuring its dimensions, chunk information,
 * reading parameters, LUT (Look-Up Table) properties, and decompression methods. It prepares the 
 * decoder for reading and processing compressed data, managing the scaling and decompression callbacks.
 * 
 * @param decoder A pointer to an `om_decoder_t` structure that will be initialized.
 * @param scale_factor A floating-point value used to scale the decompressed data.
 * @param add_offset A floating-point value used to offset the decompressed data.
 * @param compression Specifies the type of compression applied to the data.
 *                    Possible values include `COMPRESSION_PFOR_16BIT_DELTA2D`, `COMPRESSION_FPX_XOR2D`, 
 *                    and `COMPRESSION_PFOR_16BIT_DELTA2D_LOGARITHMIC`.
 * @param data_type Specifies the type of data, such as `DATA_TYPE_FLOAT` or `DATA_TYPE_DOUBLE`. This affects the decompression and copy methods used.
 * @param dimension_count The number of dimensions of the data (e.g., 3 for 3D data). All following array must have the some dimension count.
 * @param dimensions A pointer to an array containing the size of each dimension. This defines the shape of the data being read.
 * @param chunks A pointer to an array specifying the chunk sizes for each dimension and indicates how data is partitioned into chunks.
 * @param read_offset A pointer to an array specifying the offsets for reading data in each dimension. This array sets the starting points for data reads.
 * @param read_count A pointer to an array specifying the number of elements to read along each dimension. It defines how much data to read starting from `read_offset`.
 * @param cube_offset A pointer to an array specifying the offset of the target cube in each dimension. This is used when reading data into a larger array.
 * @param cube_dimensions A pointer to an array specifying the dimensions of the target cube being writen to.It can be the same as `read_count` but allows writing into larger arrays..
 * @param lut_size  The length (in bytes) of the compressed Look-Up Table (LUT). Ignored for Verion 1/2 files if lut_chunk_element_count == 1.
 * @param lut_chunk_element_count The number of elements in each LUT chunk. Default is 256. A value  of 1 indicates that the LUT is not compressed (Version 1/2 files).
 * @param lut_start  The starting byte position of the LUT in the file.
 * @param io_size_merge The maximum size (in bytes) for merging consecutive IO operations. It helps to optimize read performance by merging small reads.
 * @param io_size_max The maximum size (in bytes) for a single IO operation before it is split. It defines the threshold for splitting large reads.
 * 
 * @returns Return an om_error_t if the compression or dimension is invalid
