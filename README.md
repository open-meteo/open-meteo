## How does Open-Meteo work?
Open-Meteo utilizes open-data weather forecasts provided by national weather services. These services offer numerical weather predictions that are free to download. However, working with these models can be challenging, as it requires expertise in binary file formats, grid-systems, projections, and the fundamentals of weather predictions.

Like many other weather APIs, Open-Meteo integrates high-resolution local and global weather models. Over 2 TB of data are downloaded and processed daily from multiple national weather services. The collected data is then stored in local files using a customized file format and compression technique to enhance access to time-series data such as a 14-day temperature forecast.

In contrast to other weather APIs, Open-Meteo provides complete access to its source code, and all data sources are openly listed, crediting the national weather services for their work. With Docker or prebuilt Ubuntu packages, it is possible to launch your own weather API within minutes. By providing the source code, users can conduct detailed verifications of the weather data processing and even make modifications themselves. Contributions are highly encouraged and welcomed.

The API is available for non-commercial use at no cost. Despite being free of charge, the forecast accuracy is top-notch. The API utilizes a vast array of local weather models with rapid updates, ensuring that the most precise forecast is generated for any location globally.
